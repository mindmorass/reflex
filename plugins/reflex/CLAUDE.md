# Reflex - Claude Code Plugin

Reflex is a Claude Code plugin providing skills and RAG integration for application development, infrastructure, and data engineering workflows.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution
- Run independent subagents in parallel (multiple Task tool calls in one message)
- Use `model: "haiku"` for quick, straightforward subtasks to minimize cost/latency
- Use background subagents (`run_in_background: true`) for long-running tasks while continuing other work

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff your behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Lateness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Context Management

- **Monitor context usage**: When context feels heavy (~85% through a long session), proactively suggest `/reflex:handoff` to generate a continuation document
- **Handoff docs**: Use `/reflex:handoff` to create a structured summary for seamless session continuation
- **Periodic CLAUDE.md review**: At the start of complex tasks, re-read project CLAUDE.md to ensure alignment with project conventions
- **Offload to subagents**: Heavy exploration and research should happen in subagents to preserve main context for decision-making

## Performance

- **Enable tool search**: For faster startup with many MCP servers, users should enable lazy tool loading:
  ```bash
  claude config set --global toolSearchEnabled true
  ```
  This loads tool definitions on demand instead of all at once, reducing startup time when Reflex's MCP servers are active.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/reflex:agents` | List available agents |
| `/reflex:skills` | List available skills |
| `/reflex:mcp` | List MCP servers |
| `/reflex:gitconfig` | Display git configuration |
| `/reflex:certcollect` | Collect SSL certificates |
| `/reflex:notify` | macOS popup notifications (on/off/status/test) |
| `/reflex:speak` | Spoken notifications (on/off/status/test) |
| `/reflex:qdrant` | Control Qdrant MCP connection (on/off/status) |
| `/reflex:langfuse` | Control LangFuse observability (on/off/status) |
| `/reflex:guardrail` | Control destructive operation guardrails (on/off/status) |
| `/reflex:ingest` | Ingest files into Qdrant |
| `/reflex:update-mcp` | Check/apply MCP package updates |
| `/reflex:init` | Initialize MCP server credentials |
| `/reflex:handoff` | Generate handoff document for session continuation |

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| rag-proxy | RAG wrapper for any agent, enriches with Qdrant context |
| workflow-orchestrator | Orchestrates multi-step workflows across specialized subagents |

Most agent functionality is provided by official plugins (testing-suite, security-pro, documentation-generator, developer-essentials) and Reflex skills.

## Web Search Storage

**IMPORTANT:** After every WebSearch, store valuable results in Qdrant with rich metadata:

```
Tool: qdrant-store
Information: "<synthesized summary with key findings>"
Metadata:
  # Required
  source: "web_search"
  content_type: "text"           # text, code, image, diagram
  harvested_at: "<ISO 8601>"

  # Search context
  query: "<original query>"
  urls: ["url1", "url2"]
  domain: "<primary domain>"

  # Classification (for filtering)
  category: "<technology|business|science|design|security|devops>"
  subcategory: "<databases|frontend|ml|networking|...>"
  type: "<documentation|tutorial|troubleshooting|reference|comparison>"

  # Technical (when applicable)
  language: "<python|typescript|rust|go|...>"
  framework: "<framework name>"

  # Quality
  confidence: "<high|medium|low>"
  freshness: "<current|recent|dated>"

  # Relationships
  related_topics: ["topic1", "topic2"]
  project: "<project name or null>"
```

**Images:** Store URL references only (no download). Use `content_type: "image"`, `image_url`, `image_type`

**Skip storing:** Trivial lookups, ephemeral info, duplicates

## Git Commits

When committing changes, use this format (no Co-Authored-By):

```
<summary line>

<optional body>

```

## LangFuse Observability

Reflex includes optional LangFuse integration for tracing tool calls and agent interactions.

**Enable/Disable:**
```bash
/reflex:langfuse on      # Enable tracing
/reflex:langfuse off     # Disable tracing (default)
/reflex:langfuse status  # Show current status
```

**Required environment variables:**
```bash
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Optional, defaults to localhost
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-..."
```

When enabled, tool calls are automatically traced to LangFuse via the PostToolUse hook.

## Installation

**From marketplace:**
```
/plugin marketplace add mindmorass/reflex
